# There are 10 columns in the Super Bowl History CSV:

# Date: date, Date of Super Bowl
# SB: string, Super Bowl name
# Winner: sting, Winning team
# Winner Pts: int, Points scored by winning team
# Loser: string, Losing team
# Loser Pts: int, Points scored by losing team
# MVP: string, Most Valuable Player award recepient
# Stadium: string, Stadium name of Super Bowl
# City: string, City of Super Bowl
# State: string, State of Super Bowl

# There are 4 columns in the Super Bowl Ads CSV:

# Year: string, Year of Super Bowl
# Product/Type: string, Indusrty of ad
# Product/Title: string, Name of product
# Plot/Notes: string, Description of commercial

#-----------------------------------------------------#

# There are two CSV files that are in this project. The datasets are structured by rows
# with headers as the attributes. Each have very different attritbutes, but the main and only attribute
# that is similar in both datasets is the Date in the History and the Year in the Ads. Since there is
# only 1 Super Bowl in a year, it will help comine and merge the two datasets together and analyze
# the data better and in more detail.

# After combining the two datasets, the dataset will have 13 columns. And the same number
# of columns. Another thing to do is to change all of the Product/Type into categories, theyâ€™re are
# similiraties like Soft Drink and Beer or Web hosting and Wireless. These will be assigned to Beverages
# and Technology, respectively.
